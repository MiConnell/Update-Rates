# Update-Rates
Loops through lines in a quote and updates based on user input

This program updates the rates and recalculates all lines for a quote in Visual. 

To use:

Enter the exact quote number you wish to update.
Enter percentages as two digit numbers in each box, in the same order you would in the quote in Visual. 
You should always update before recalculating.

After you enter the correct quote number and the rates you wish to use, click the update button on the menu bar.
If the quote number or any rates are incorrect, you will get an error message stating that.

After you have successfully updated the rates, do not clear the screen. 
Click the recalculate button.

This program will recalculate based on the rates you have entered here, not based on the rates in Visual, so it is important that the rates used to update are the same as the rates used to recalculate.

Once you have updated and recalculated, you are all done. There is no need to save anything.
Go into Visual and refresh the quote.\nThe rates and prices will be updated and rounded to the nearest whole dollar.

Shortcut keys:

Ctrl+R: Recalculate
Ctrl+U: Update
F2: Reset
Esc: Close Message
Ctrl+H: Help
Alt+Q: Quit
